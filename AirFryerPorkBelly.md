## Instructions

1. Submerge pork belly in a pot of water with ginger, scallions, star anise, bay leaf (optional). Cook for 10 mins skin side down, flip 5-10 mins meat side down depending how thick.
2. Take pork belly out, use a fork, metal skewers, bamboo skewer sticks or whatever is sharp and start stabbing the pork belly skin. You want LOTS and LOTS of holes. Stab stab stab!
3. Flip pork belly over and score the pork belly vertically. Lay pork belly <————> cut up and down.
4. Season (meat side) with five spice powder, Sichuan peppercorn powder, sugar, dark soy sauce, light soy sauce, white pepper, light on the salt. Try not get the skin wet with the dark soy sauce and light soy sauce. If you do, you want to pat it dry with the next 3 steps.
5. Next 3 steps (6-8) is required if you plan to cook same day. If you plan to cook next day, you can skip the last dehydration part in step 8.
6. Using a clean cloth or paper towel, pat dry the skin especially if you got soy sauce on it. Brush vinegar and sprinkle salt onto the skin and let it sit for 15 minutes. You will see that any extra moisture will rise to the top of the skin. Both these ingredients help with drawing water out of the meat. Pat dry.
7. Once it’s dry. You will repeat this step again. Brush vinegar and sprinkle salt on the skin. Wait 15 minutes, then pat dry.
8. Now, To make sure we really got all the moisture out of the skin. We will use the dehydration function on the air fryer. Wrap pork belly up with foil, place it in the dehydrator for 50-1 hour at 130F. You can check on it at 45 minutes and see how it feels. We had a thicker piece so I kept it in for an extra 20 minutes to ensure it was dry enough. It was in for an hour and 20 mins.
9. Now we air fry! 400F for 25 mins - 30 mins depending on the size.
