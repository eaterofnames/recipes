# Recipe title

This is a vegetarian ramen that's pretty easy, but yields a really flavorful soup. The key takeaway is to not burn the broth base. You can substitute literally all of it. Quantities listed are for one very hungry person. If served with sides, this will feed two.

Oh, and this recipe is from when I was pescatarian, so there might be a few places with fish products in it. There's veg substitutes for all of them.

## Ingredients

- roasted sesame oil
- 2 Green onions
- 2 garlic cloves
- 0.5" of ginger
- 1/4 cup Mirin
- 2 Tbsp Miso Paste. I used a dashi-style combination of red and white.
- 2 Tbsp Lao Gan Ma brand fermented bean paste in chili oil.
- 1.5 cups unsweetened original oat milk
- 2" x 2" square of kombu
- 1.5 cups water
- 2 dried shiitake mushrooms
- fresh ramen noodles

## Instructions

### Prep work

Start this stuff at least 1hr before you want to serve the ramen.

1. Soak the mushrooms and kombu in the water in a small pot for 30-45 minutes.
2. While it's soaking, mince the green onions, garlic, and ginger. Set them aside. The garlic + ginger will be used together.
3. Once the time is up, bring the small pot to a boil.
4. Just before a rolling boil, pull the kombu.
5. Just after the rolling boil, pull the mushrooms. Save the mushrooms if you want them in the ramen, discard the kombu.

### Broth

1. Bring a heavy-bottomed pot up to medium-high temp.
2. Add sesame oil. Once it shimmers, sautee the green onions until barely translucent.
3. Saute the garlic and ginger until fragrant, 30-40s.
4. Add the miso and chili paste mix. Stir 3-5m constantly so it doesn't burn.
5. Add the mirin to deglaze the pot.
6. Slowly (like actually annoyingly slowly, this matters) stir the oat milk into the broth paste. Do the kombu water next.
7. Once completely combined, bring to a really gentle simmer for at least 10 minutes to let flavors hang out and get to know each other.
8. Taste the broth, adjust seasoning (miso + chili paste) as needed.

### Noodles

1. Boil noodles.
2. Put into bowl
3. Pour broth over noodles.
4. Add some [King Oyster Mushrooms](koreanOysterMushrooms.md)
5. Top with some kimchi because you're already a heathen and the rules don't matter
