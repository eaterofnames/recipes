# Recipe title

A delicious chili oil. Medium heat, goes great with dumplings and in all sorts of things.

Everything in here can be subbed out for something else, but it will change the temperature at which you roast the chili flake.

The basic goal is to do two things:

1. Infuse a neutral oil with hella flavor
2. Roast a chili flake with that infused oil

## Ingredients

- 2 cups neutral oil
- Star anise
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 2 bay leaves
- 2-3 Tbsp sichuan peppercorns
- 2 tbsp black sesame seeds
- 5-6 peeled and crushed garlic gloves
- 1 - 1 1/2 cups sichuan chili flake

## Instructions

1. Crush the black sesame seeds into paste.
2. Roast that paste in a little bit of the neutral oil.
3. Add the rest of the oil, lower the pan heat to very low
4. Add the rest of the aromatics. Bring to a gentle simmer for 45 minutes. You want it somewhere around 220-250F, enough to gently bubble from the aromatics.
5. Remove anything that is about to burn during the simmering. If you need to, cool the pot to 220 F before pouring over the chili flake.
6. Pour the infused oil through a screen and into the sichuan chili flake, using a heat-resistant bowl. Stir evenly but not vigorously.

Oil keeps for up to 6 months if stored in an airtight container, and if proper hygeine is observed.
